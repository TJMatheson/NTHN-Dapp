This is a super simple app I made when first learning about solidity.

## To run:

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm i`
- Open the app with `npm start`
- Your browser should automatically open, but if not you can manually navigate to locahost:3000
- Run tests with `npm run test`
Instructions to interact with the smart contract are on the main page.
You will need the metamask browser add-on, and you will need some Rinkeby (testnet) ETH:

- Metamask: [Metamask website](https://metamask.io/)
- Rinkeby: [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
